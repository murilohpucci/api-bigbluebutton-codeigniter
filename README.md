# api-bigbluebutton-codeigniter
This repository is a simple interface using CodeIgniter 3 with bigbluebutton api in PHP. 

The main objective is create a simple rest api skeleton and integrate with bbb php api.

The usage is simple, but you must have at least PHP 5.4+ and composer.

After clone or download the repository, run "composer install" in application folder. After that configure the project in a webserver.

That's it! Now you have a new api skeleton using codeigniter framework integrated with bigbluebutton api!

Please wait for more updates.

Thanks!
